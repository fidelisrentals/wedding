<!-- About Jake Yordie -->
<div class="w3-container w3-padding-64 w3-pale-red" id="us">
  <h1 class="w3-center w3-text-grey"><b>Our Love Story</b></h1>
    
    <div class="w3-content" style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
      <div>
        <p><i>It all began on a beautiful September day in 2020 in Rolla, Missouri. Jake had been pursuing Yordie for nearly a year before he finally convinced her to go on a date. Once they met, there was no turning back.</i></p><br>

        <p><i>Months before their first date, Jake had visited Kirksville, Missouri, hoping to see Yordie while visiting a friend at Truman State University. Fate, however, had other plans, and their paths did not cross then. Five months later, Yordie made the three-hour drive to Rolla with her beloved dog, Chewy, to see her friend G and to finally meet Jake.</i></p><br>
          
        <p><i>Their first date was a perfect blend of adventure and intimacy. They hiked with Chewy, enjoyed homemade pizza and wine, and played games on the Wii at Jake's house. The day was calm, safe, and comfortable, a testament to the many conversations and FaceTime calls they'd shared before meeting in person. As the evening drew to a close, they decided to extend their night by meeting up with Jake’s track friends at the local bars, giving Yordie a glimpse into his college life.</i></p><br>
          
        <p><i>That first date was such a success that they met again just two weeks later. Four months after their initial meeting, they officially became a couple. Their love grew stronger with each passing day, and their relationship blossomed into something truly special. Meeting each other was the highlight of their junior and senior years in college, made even more beautiful by its unexpectedness. They shared countless cherished moments, from cooking together and hiking to traveling and enjoying delicious meals.</i></p><br>

        <p><i>Their journey wasn't always easy. When Yordie moved to Georgia, their three-hour distance turned into thirteen, then sixteen hours to Arizona, and overseas to Poland. Despite the challenges, they made it work, flying tirelessly to see each other on weekends and surprising one another whenever possible. Jake's first flight to Georgia to visit Yordie marked the beginning of many adventures together.</i></p><br>

        <p><i>After navigating life’s ups and downs, the moment finally arrived when Jake asked Yordie to marry him. On May 22, 2023, Jake, with the help of Yordie's friend Anika, planned a hike at the Sand Dunes National Park. Unbeknownst to Yordie, Jake had orchestrated everything from 14 hours away. As she reached the summit, Jake was there, ready to ask her to be his wife. It was, as Yordie described, the most beautiful day.</i></p><br>

        <p><i>Now, as they prepare for another beautiful day surrounded by their loved ones, Jake and Yordie are thrilled to celebrate their love with you. They are grateful and happy, looking forward to sharing their joy and the next chapter of their lives together with all those they hold dear.</i></p><br>
